# Mastermind

This is a simple implementation of the classic Mastermind game (AKA the original Wordle) in Python. Mastermind is a code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a secret code within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play

To start the program, navigate to the project directory and run the game: 
`py mastermind_driver.py`

You can make a guess by clicking the marbles at the bottom of the screen, filling the guess in at that interval. Clicking the X button will clear it, while the checkmark submits that guess to be evaluated. A red mark in the evaluation indicates that there is a correct color in the guess, while a black mark indicates that the correct color is in the correct position. The game ends and records your # of guesses when you guess the code correctly.
