This is basic version of Mastermind, aka the first Wordle. It uses the turtle package to draw the interface and the HUD, and basic Python for the remaining functionality. 

When first developing the project, we decided to use an object-oriented design to resolve the challenges of not having the ability (or the intention) of using global variables. Because of this, we were able to more easily access variables and objects such as the color code key (correct answer), the different turtles to draw the different shapes and popups, and variables that assess where the user clicked on the screen. 

Development took around 2-3 days, and I'm super proud of the result! Thanks for reading.
